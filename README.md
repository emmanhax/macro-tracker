# AI-Powered Macro Tracker ðŸ¥‘ðŸ“Š

A nutrition tracking app that lets me log meals using natural language through ChatGPT. Built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Supabase, this project combines AI, database design, and frontend development to solve a real problem in my daily life.

## Features
- Log meals and macros quickly with GPT output
- Store meal entries in Supabase
- View daily calories, protein, carbs, and fat
- Designed to be fast, clean, and mobile-friendly

## Stack
- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Postgres DB)
- ChatGPT (for meal parsing)

## Goal
This is a personal-use app that Iâ€™ll run on my phone like a native app. Eventually Iâ€™ll expand it to include training logs, visualizations, and full AI integration.
